# time-record-system

-How much time did you spend?
approx 12 hours in 3 days.

Difficulties that you found in the task?
Used Nestjs and Graphql for the very first time. Also used @apollo/client for react for the first time.
I had many errors and headaches throughout the developing process.
If I have to pick which was the most challenging part of this task it would be the implementation of mutation using useMutation and type correctly the gql syntax
